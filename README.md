runtime management and modification of Zend Framework application configuration files.

## Requirements

];
```

## Configuration

### User Configuration

The top-level configuration key for user configuration of this module is `zf-configuration`.

```php
'zf-configuration' => [
    'config_file' => 'config/autoload/development.php',
    'enable_short_array' => false,
    'class_name_scalars' => false,
],
```

#### Key: `enable_short_array`

Set this value to a boolean `true` if you want to use PHP 5.4's square bracket (aka "short") array
syntax.

#### Key: `class_name_scalars`

- Since 1.2.1

Set this value to a boolean `true` if you want to use PHP 5.5's class name scalars (`::class` notation).

### ZF Events

There are no events or listeners.

### ZF Services

#### ZF\Configuration\ConfigWriter

`ZF\Configuration\ConfigWriter` is by default an instance of `Zend\Config\Writer\PhpArray`.  This
service serves the purpose of providing the necessary dependencies for `ConfigResource` and
`ConfigResourceFactory`.

#### ZF\Configuration\ConfigResource

`ZF\Configuration\ConfigResource` service is used for modifying an existing configuration files with
methods such as `patch()` and `replace()`.  The service returned by the service manager is bound to
the file specified in the `config_file` key.

#### ZF\Configuration\ConfigResourceFactory

`ZF\Configuration\ConfigResourceFactory` is a factory service that provides consumers with the
ability to create `ZF\Configuration\ConfigResource` objects, with dependencies injected for specific
config files (not the one listed in the `module.config.php`.

#### ZF\Configuration\ModuleUtils

`ZF\Configuration\ModuleUtils` is a service that consumes the `ModuleManager` and provides the
ability to traverse modules to find their path on disk as well as the path to their configuration
files.
